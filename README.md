# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 solutions repository! This year, I'll be solving two puzzles each day, writing all solutions in Ruby, and including RSpec tests to validate my solutions against the sample inputs provided on the Advent of Code website.

For my own practice of better habits, I'll also be writing YARD-based documentation.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual event featuring daily programming puzzles from December 1st to 25th. Each day includes two puzzles, where the second puzzle builds on the first. It’s a fun and festive way to practice problem-solving and coding!

## Why Ruby?

I work in Ruby every day for the day-job, so it's what I'm most familiar with. This is my first year doing Advent of Code, so I wanted something I could write in without thinking about some of the basic syntax along the way.

## Repository Structure

Each day’s solutions are in the root-level puzzles/ directory with a single Ruby file for each day, while all spec files are located in the root-level spec/ directory:

```plaintext
+ inputs/
-   day_XX.txt          # Input data for the puzzles (Not in the repo, but expected for local runs)
+ puzzles/
-   day_XX.rb           # Ruby solution file for Day XX
+ spec/
-   day_XX_spec.rb      # RSpec tests for Day XX
-   spec_helper.rb      # RSpec configuration file
+ utilities/
-   advent_helpers.rb   # Helper methods for Advent of Code solutions
```

## Input Data

Puzzle input files (day_XX.txt) are not included in this repository and are part of the .gitignore. Place your input file in the corresponding inputs/ folder when running the scripts.

## Spec Tests

RSpec tests for all days are located in the spec/ directory. Each day’s spec file corresponds to its solution file:

- `spec/day_XX_spec.rb`: Contains tests for the logic in `day_XX/day_XX.rb`.

## YARD Documentation

I am using YARD to document the code in this repository. You can generate and view the documentation locally.

### Generating Documentation

To compile the YARD documentation, run:

```bash
yard doc
```

This will generate the documentation in the doc/ directory.

### Viewing Documentation

You can view the compiled documentation locally by opening doc/_index.html in your web browser:

```bash
open doc/_index.html
```

(Replace open with your system’s default command for opening files, such as xdg-open on Linux.)

If you prefer, you can start a YARD server to serve the documentation locally:

```bash
yard server
```

Navigate to the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:8808) in your browser to view the documentation.
